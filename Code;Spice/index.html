                    <p>Code;Spice is a coding camp completely free of charge for kids of all ages that would like to learn Python, relatively simple algorithmic thinking, how to get started on their own project, or just the coding philosophy in general. The classes are separated into two types of classes. The advanced class works on more complex projects like USACO, websites, games, you name it! The beginners class is more for reinforcing and getting proficient at Python. Throughout the school year, we will be meeting once a week for each type of class for 1.5 hours, in addition to optional 2 hour long office hours for both classes to help students with questions or problems. Recordings of classes will be posted for participants that missed classes, so don't worry about being a latecomer or missing any classes! In the end, we hope for participants to not only learn how to code, but to learn how to code more efficiently, and most importantly, have fun!</p>

                <h3>Beginner Python</h3>
                <p>This class is meant to teach students the basics of Python. Python is a very popular, useful, and easy language to learn that is very suitable for beginners. It can be utilized to create many things, from games to implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you are not very familiar with Python or have never programmed before, then this course would be perfect for you. In this course, we will learn about syntax, different Python tools, the most prevalent basic data structures, simple algorithmic thinking, and basic problem-solving techniques. A couple examples of what we will learn are the different types of loops, different Python built-in functions, and Object-Oriented programming.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="AP" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Advanced Python</h3>
                <p>In this class, we will start applying Python in more involved settings. This class will be more project based and a decently strong background and understanding of Python is recommended. Initially, instructors will be leading and lecturing with project development, but soon, students will be completing their own projects with the guidance of instructors.</p> 
            </div>

            <div id="BC" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Basic C++</h3>
                <p>This class is meant to teach students the basics of C++. C++ is a very popular language for competitive programming and can also be applied to make different things like operating systems, games, and graphical user interfaces (GUIS). Much like the beginner Python class, if you are not very familiar with C++ or have never programmed before, then this course would be perfect for you. In this course, we will learn about syntax, different C++ tools, the most prevalent basic data structures, simple algorithmic thinking, and basic problem-solving techniques.  A couple examples of what we will learn are the different types of loops and different C++ built-in functions.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="BJ" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Basic Java</h3>
                <p>This class is meant to teach students the basics of Java. Java is also a very popular language for competitive programming and can also be applied mainly for back-end development projects, Android development, etc. Much like the beginner Python class, if you are not very familiar with Java or have never programmed before, then this course would be perfect for you. In this course, we will learn about syntax, different Javatools, the most prevalent basic data structures, simple algorithmic thinking, and basic problem-solving techniques.  A couple examples of what we will learn are the different types of loops and different Java built-in functions.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="APCSA" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>AP Computer Science A</h3>
                <p>This class is an extension of the Basic Java class. It is much more advanced and is designed to prepare students for the AP Computer Science A exam/class that they can take in high school. A decent understanding of Java is recommended for this class. Students will learn about more complex algorithms, techniques, etc. An example of some topics are recursions, implementing the different types of sorts, and Object Oriented programming. Our class will be relatively based on the AP Computer Science A curriculum, in which more information can be found <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a"  target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
            </div>

            <div id="ADS" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
                <p>The algorithms and data structures is a course meant to introduce and teach some of the easier and basic algorithms to students. For example, students will learn the Greedy and simulation algorithm, as well as different useful and unique data structures that may be associated with these algorithms. This is meant to begin helping students develop an algorithmic mindset and is also meant to help students pass USACO Bronze or other coding competitions of a similar level. A proficiency with a coding language, particularly Java, C++, or Python is strongly recommended for this class.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="PC" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Private Classes</h3>
                <p>Private classes are very flexible, negotiable classes that are determined between the instructor and the students. Both the time, frequency, and topic of the classes are determined by the students. Private classes can be chosen to be any class size (for instance, we can arrange one instructor to teach one student or two students or three students etc.), however, a MANDATORY donation of 15 dollars/hour per person is REQUIRED. This donation will go into a Code;Spice bank account that is strictly meant to save money to donate to other worthy causes or support the further growth of the Code;Spice organization to help more students around the world. We greatly appreciate any donations that will help us support our own or other causes!</p>
